Expert Quran Tutors</strong></h3>\n<p data-start=\"1255\" data-end=\"1518\">A true Quran academy is built on the expertise of its teachers.

Whether you are a parent selecting a program for your child or a learner seeking serious study, choosing the right academy is essential for making progress in recitation, memorization, and understanding.</p>\n<h2 data-start=\"795\" data-end=\"836\"><strong data-start=\"798\" data-end=\"836\">What Makes a “best quran academy”?</strong></h2>\n<h3 data-start=\"838\" data-end=\"884\">1. <strong data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"882\">Qualified &amp; Certified Instructors</strong></h3>\n<p data-start=\"885\" data-end=\"1321\">The foundation of any excellent academy lies in its teachers.
